MEI Mapping Version Control Structure

NOTES

From project base - data directory can be preserved or shared (provides map layer and geojson file)

In project directory create symlink to mml w/ correct references - is the mml file going to change?

Interactivity layers read from the last entry (overwriting anything above)

Any changes to information in the settings menu will overwrite changes manually applied to the mml file
